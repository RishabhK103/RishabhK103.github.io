          Built during a 24-hour hackathon, EduLite OS is a custom Linux distro
          crafted for students and schools with limited hardware access. Based
          on Xubuntu and optimized with LXQt, ZRAM, and minimal background
          services, it runs beautifully on machines with ‚â§2GB RAM. It comes
          pre-installed with offline learning tools like Kolibri, Python
          educational apps, and custom teacher dashboards. We even designed a
          future-ready UI for AI chatbot integration, exam/test mode, and voice
          support.

          Built in a 24-hour hackathon, Aryabhatta Search is an AI-powered
          platform that simplifies learning discovery for users across all
          academic levels‚Äîfrom kindergarten to post-graduation. It uses Groq's
          LLaMA 3 to generate personalized, structured summaries based on user
          age and educational background, and recommends books and resources
          using TF-IDF on past search history. The platform integrates Google
          Custom Search for broader results, supports community forums and
          parental controls, and was built using a modern full-stack setup with
          Next.js, Supabase, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. BTW we win this hackathon
          at innovate you techathon.

          Developed during a hackathon, this project predicts whether a research
          paper is publishable and recommends the most relevant top-tier
          conference, including CVPR, NeurIPS, EMNLP, TMLR, and KDD. It
          leverages SciBERT for generating contextual embeddings, a
          self-training classifier for publishability assessment, and
          Sentence-BERT for similarity-based conference matching. The tool
          processes labeled and unlabeled paper datasets and outputs predictions
          in CSV format, offering a practical assistive tool for early-stage
          researchers. We secured first prize in this hackathon held at Army
          Institute of Technolgy,Pune.

          This project provides a modular system to automate fantasy cricket
          team selection using historical and recent player performance data. It
          calculates form scores via exponentially weighted averages of batting,
          bowling, and fielding metrics, normalized to a 0‚Äì100 scale. Using
          these scores, the system optimizes an 11-player fantasy team via
          linear programming (PuLP), applying constraints like role quotas and
          leadership multipliers (captain, vice-captain). The architecture
          supports CLI and Docker usage, with a clean codebase powered by a
          YAML-configured pipeline.
