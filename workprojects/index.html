          What started as an experiment to understand bias in language models
          turned into a deep-dive into model alignment. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on
          the Jigsaw toxic comment dataset using PEFT and QLoRA, then served it
          through a Flask API with session tracking. A React.js frontend
          provided an intuitive interface for testing and interacting with the
          model. We also explored how multimodal generation behaves in this
          context by integrating Stable Diffusion for text-to-image and
          image-to-image prompts. MLflow tracked the experiments, and DVC helped
          manage the model and dataset versions throughout.
