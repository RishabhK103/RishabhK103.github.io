        A collection of the projects I‚Äôve worked on during my college journey.
        These projects showcase my skills in software development, machine
        learning, and more.

          Made for MLops endsem examination it is a full-stack machine learning
          application for predicting the likelihood of 8 different diseases,
          built with FastAPI for the backend and React with TailwindCSS for the
          frontend. The app allows users to submit data, receive predictions,
          and retrain the model via API endpoints. Integrated with MLflow for
          experiment tracking and Docker for deployment.

        <p>
          This is the first actual python project I made, although simple it was
          vcreated during my first year of engineering . This project combines
          speech recognition and text summarization using Python and OpenAI's
          API. The application captures spoken input, converts it to text using
          Google's speech recognition service, and then summarizes the text
          using OpenAI's language models. This tool is ideal for quickly
          obtaining summaries from verbal content, making it useful for
          note-taking, transcriptions, and more.

        <p>
          This project implements a stock price prediction application using
          linear regression. The app allows users to input stock symbols and
          date ranges to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
          Using this data, a linear regression model is trained to predict the
          next day's stock price based on features such as open, high, low, and
          close prices. The model‚Äôs performance is evaluated using mean squared
          error (MSE), and users can interact with the app through an intuitive
          Streamlit interface to visualize data and get predictions.

        <p>
          This Streamlit web application manages an airline's flights, crew, and
          bookings using an SQLite database. It supports two user roles: Admin
          and Customer. The Admin can log in, add flight details (flight number,
          departure/arrival airports, times, aircraft type, ticket price), and
          manage the database. Customers can view available flights and book
          them by providing passenger details and booking information. The app
          also supports key functions like creating necessary database tables
          and adding new flight and booking records.
