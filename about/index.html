      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Currently pursuing Engineering and in love with tech and software
        development.

      <p>
        I've always been passionate about technology, especially gaming, since I
        was a kid. Coming from a business background, I initially considered
        joining my family's business. However, the impact of COVID-19 led me to
        pursue engineering, and looking back, it turned out to be one of the
        best decisions I've ever made. Now solving problems and creating good
        software is all I yearn for. Still figuring things out, but I know I’m
        on the right path.

        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, C++, JavaScript. I
            mostly use Python as the core building block of my projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frameworks & Libraries:</strong> FastAPI, Flask, Django for
            web apps, and Scikit-learn & TensorFlow for machine learning; MLflow
            & Gradio for MLOps and testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tools & Platforms:</strong> Git for version control, Arch
            Linux for daily use, VS Code & Jupyter Notebook for coding and
            experimentation .Currently trying switching to neovim for faster
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concepts & Practices:</strong> Machine learning pipelines,
            data analysis, MLOps workflows, and cloud basics(Mostly AWS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Interests:</strong> Exploring operating systems and
            CUDA for GPU programming, hoping to make some open source
            contributions there.

        <h2>Software That Inspires Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CPUs:</strong> It’s insane how tiny chips packed with
            billions of transistors can understand zeros and ones and somehow
            run entire worlds. The fact that this was engineered by people just
            boggles my brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CUDA:</strong>CUDA is a game changer for the AI world. It’s
            the reason of NVIDIA’s dominance, allowing GPUs to process thousands
            of tasks in parallel with unmatched efficiency. While there are
            other technologies emerging, nothing quite matches CUDA’s level of
            performance and ecosystem in driving forward AI and machine
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS:</strong>Every time I think about AWS, I’m just blown
            away by how so many different systems like storage, compute,
            networking work together flawlessly at such massive scale. The way
            these pieces integrate and evolve, each one feeding into the next,
            is pure genius. It’s like they’ve built this intricate web of
            technology, and it just works perfectly
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Containers & Virtualization:</strong> Running a whole system
            inside another system? And it actually works? Every time I learn how
            Docker or virtual machines isolate environments, I pause and think —
            how is this even real?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Python Ecosystem:</strong> Python is a vibe. The fact that
            almost anything you imagine — web apps, data science, AI, scripting
            — already has a package ready for it... It’s like standing on the
            shoulders of countless brilliant people.

        <h2>Why I Love Arch Linux</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Arch Linux isn’t just an operating system to me, it’s a lifestyle. The
          way it gives you complete control over every little part of your
          system made me fall in love with it. It taught me how Linux actually
          works under the hood, from bootloaders to package managers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve broken things, fixed them, learned the hard way, and loved every
          second of it. Arch doesn’t hold your hand, and that’s the best part —
          it makes you *earn* your system, and you come out smarter every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time I boot into my clean, minimal, hand-crafted setup, I’m
          reminded why I chose Arch. It’s fast, lightweight, and completely
          mine. And yes... I use Arch, btw :)
