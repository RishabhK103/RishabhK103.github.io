I like building things with technology and seeing ideas turn into something real. I enjoy experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way. Most of my time goes into making software that feels useful, fun, or simply interesting to build. There’s no fixed destination just curiosity, iteration, and the joy of creating.
If it didn’t break at least once, it probably wasn’t built properly.      </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, C++, JavaScript,Typescript and a sprinkle of rust.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frameworks & Libraries:</strong> FastAPI, Flask, Django,Langchain, React.js, Next.js,
            Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, MLflow, Gradio.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tools & Platforms:</strong> Git, Arch Linux, VS Code,
            Jupyter, Neovim, And now literally all the AI IDEs Antigravity, Cursor, etc

        <h2>Pieces of Software/Engineering that blows my mind and made me persue tech as a career</h2>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CPUs:</strong> It’s insane how tiny chips packed with
            billions of transistors can understand zeros and ones and somehow
            run entire worlds. The fact that this was engineered by people just
            boggles my brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CUDA:</strong>CUDA is a game changer for the AI world. It’s
            the reason of NVIDIA’s dominance, allowing GPUs to process thousands
            of tasks in parallel with unmatched efficiency. While there are
            other technologies emerging, nothing quite matches CUDA’s level of
            performance and ecosystem in driving forward AI and machine
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud :</strong>Every time I think about AWS, I’m just blown
            away by how so many different systems like storage, compute,
            networking work together flawlessly at such massive scale. The way
            these pieces integrate and evolve, each one feeding into the next,
            is pure genius. It’s like they’ve built this intricate web of
            technology, and it just works perfectly
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Containers & Virtualization:</strong> Running a whole system
            inside another system? And it actually works? Every time I learn how
            Docker or virtual machines isolate environments, I pause and think 
            how is this even real?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Python Ecosystem:</strong> Python is a vibe. The fact that
            almost anything you imagine  web apps, data science, AI, scripting
             already has a package ready for it... It’s like standing on the
            shoulders of countless brilliant people.

        <h2>Why I Love Arch Linux</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Arch Linux isn’t just an OS, it’s a lifestyle. It taught me how Linux
          works under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve broken things, fixed them, learned the hard way, and loved every
          second of it. Arch doesn’t hold your hand and that’s the best part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time I boot into my clean, minimal, hand-crafted setup, I’m
          reminded why I chose Arch. And yes... I use Arch, btw :)
